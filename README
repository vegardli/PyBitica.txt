# PyBitica.txt

Script/daemon for syncronizing todo.txt with the habitica to-do list.

Very much a work in progress, may contain bugs that will wreck your todo.txt and Habitica todo list. Use with caution,
and please report any bugs!

## Feature map:
(A) Implement syncing of changes to todo (currently any changes after creation are ignored)
(B) Implement options to disable sorting of todos locally and on Habitica
(C) Implement project, context and addon info is saved in "notes" in Habitica
x Implement todo creaton syncing both ways
x Implement todo completion syncing both ways
x Implement sorting of tasks by priority, date and text on Habitica
x Implement attaching Habitica ID to local tasks

## Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

## Installation (GNU/Linux and friends)
* Install prerequisites
* Run pybitica.txt.py once, enter user ID, API key and todo.txt file location
* Create cron job to run pybitica.txt.py in reasonable intervals. I would not recommend more often than every 5
  minutes, since every run does incur quite a few requests to the Habitica API
